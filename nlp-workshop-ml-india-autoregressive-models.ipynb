This allows you to quickly prototype different research ideas in a flexible way with minimal code.\n\n\nA classic RNN appears as follows:\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/627/1*go8PHsPNbbV6qRiwpUQ5BQ.png\">\n\nThis [video](https://youtu.be/8HyCNIVRbSU) provides a good description of how RNNs work.\n\n\nParticulary a RNN works on the logic:\n\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*3mDe6V5DRXqpHYKDfxN4Rg.png\">\n\n\nThere are various kinds of such networks:\n\n\n- Encoding Recurrent Neural Networks are just folds. They’re often used to allow a neural network to take a variable length list as input, for example taking a sentence as input.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/img/RNN-encoding.png\">\n\n\n- Generating Recurrent Neural Networks are just unfolds. They’re often used to allow a neural network to produce a list of outputs, such as words in a sentence.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/img/RNN-generating.png\">\n\n\n- General Recurrent Neural Networks are accumulating maps. They’re often used when we’re trying to make predictions in a sequence. For example, in voice recognition, we might wish to predict a phenome for every time step in an audio segment, based on past context.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/img/RNN-general.png\">\n\n\n- Bidirectional Recursive Neural Networks are a more obscure variant, which I mention primarily for flavor. In functional programming terms, they are a left and a right accumulating map zipped together. They’re used to make predictions over a sequence with both past and future context.\n\n<img src=\"https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/img/RNN-bidirectional.png\">\n\n \n \nSome resources for understanding the derivatives and optimization inside the RNNs:\n\n- [Maths](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tingwuwang/rnn_tutorial.pdf)\n- [Blog](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/)\n- [Blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/under-the-hood-of-neural-networks-part-2-recurrent-af091247ba78)\n- [Kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/abhilash1910/nlp-workshop-ml-india#Neural-Networks)\n\n\nThese are some starter resources for creating preliminary networks for sentiment analysis, text/intent classifications. There will be some advanced architectures which will be focussed later.\n\n\n### Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)\n\n[Drawbacks of RNNS](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/): One of the appeals of RNNs is the idea that they might be able to connect previous information to the present task, such as using previous video frames might inform the understanding of the present frame. If RNNs could do this, they’d be extremely useful. But can they? It depends.Sometimes, we only need to look at recent information to perform the present task. For example, consider a language model trying to predict the next word based on the previous ones. If we are trying to predict the last word in “the clouds are in the sky,” we don’t need any further context – it’s pretty obvious the next word is going to be sky. In such cases, where the gap between the relevant information and the place that it’s needed is small, RNNs can learn to use the past information.But there are also cases where we need more context. Consider trying to predict the last word in the text “I grew up in France… I speak fluent French.” Recent information suggests that the next word is probably the name of a language, but if we want to narrow down which language, we need the context of France, from further back. It’s entirely possible for the gap between the relevant information and the point where it is needed to become very large.\nUnfortunately, as that gap grows, RNNs become unable to learn to connect the information.In theory, RNNs are absolutely capable of handling such “long-term dependencies.” A human could carefully pick parameters for them to solve toy problems of this form. Sadly, in practice, RNNs don’t seem to be able to learn them. The problem was explored in depth by Hochreiter (1991) [German] and Bengio, et al. (1994), who found some pretty fundamental reasons why it might be difficult.\nThankfully, LSTMs don’t have this problem!\n\n- LSTMs:\n \n <img src=\"https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/img/LSTM3-chain.png\">\n \n The first step in our LSTM is to decide what information we’re going to throw away from the cell state. This decision is made by a sigmoid layer called the “forget gate layer.” It looks at ```ht−1``` and ```xt```, and outputs a number between 0 and 1 for each number in the cell state ```Ct−1```. A 1 represents “completely keep this” while a 0 represents “completely get rid of this.”\n\nLet’s go back to our example of a language model trying to predict the next word based on all the previous ones. In such a problem, the cell state might include the gender of the present subject, so that the correct pronouns can be used. When we see a new subject, we want to forget the gender of the old subject.\n\n<img src=\"https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/img/LSTM3-focus-f.png\">\n\n\nThe next step is to decide what new information we’re going to store in the cell state. This has two parts. First, a sigmoid layer called the “input gate layer” decides which values we’ll update. Next, a tanh layer creates a vector of new candidate values, ```C~t```, that could be added to the state. In the next step, we’ll combine these two to create an update to the state.\n\nIn the example of our language model, we’d want to add the gender of the new subject to the cell state, to replace the old one we’re forgetting.\n\n<img src=\"https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/img/LSTM3-focus-i.png\">\n\nIt’s now time to update the old cell state, ```Ct−1```, into the new cell state ```Ct```. The previous steps already decided what to do, we just need to actually do it.\n\nWe multiply the old state by ```ft```, forgetting the things we decided to forget earlier. Then we add ```it∗C~t```. This is the new candidate values, scaled by how much we decided to update each state value.\n\nIn the case of the language model, this is where we’d actually drop the information about the old subject’s gender and add the new information, as we decided in the previous steps.\n\n<img src=\"https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/img/LSTM3-focus-C.png\">\n\nFinally, we need to decide what we’re going to output. This output will be based on our cell state, but will be a filtered version. First, we run a sigmoid layer which decides what parts of the cell state we’re going to output. Then, we put the cell state through tanh (to push the values to be between −1 and 1) and multiply it by the output of the sigmoid gate, so that we only output the parts we decided to.\n\nFor the language model example, since it just saw a subject, it might want to output information relevant to a verb, in case that’s what is coming next. For example, it might output whether the subject is singular or plural, so that we know what form a verb should be conjugated into if that’s what follows next.\n\n<img src=\"https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/img/LSTM3-focus-o.png\">\n\n\nAn illustrated working of the LSTM is provided:\n\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1900/1*GjehOa513_BgpDDP6Vkw2Q.gif\">\n\n\nSome blogs:\n\n- [Blog](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftowardsdatascience.com%2Fillustrated-guide-to-lstms-and-gru-s-a-step-by-step-explanation-44e9eb85bf21&psig=AOvVaw3GJ2-g9jyCgtlUxlTAmyJ8&ust=1608535825759000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CA0QjhxqFwoTCLjax4eF3O0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)\n- [Blog](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/12/fundamentals-of-deep-learning-introduction-to-lstm/)\n- [Blog](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-long-short-term-memory-networks-experts/)\n- [Paper](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43905.pdf)\n\nThere are several Variants of LSTMs some of the most famous being Depth GRU /Gated Recurrent Units:\n\nA slightly more dramatic variation on the LSTM is the Gated Recurrent Unit, or GRU, introduced by Cho, et al. (2014). It combines the forget and input gates into a single “update gate.” It also merges the cell state and hidden state, and makes some other changes. The resulting model is simpler than standard LSTM models, and has been growing increasingly popular.\n\n<img

There are many variants of attention such as Bahdanau Attention, Luong Attention, Dot Product Attention,Self Attention. A detailed description of the attention mechanism is provided in this [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/colearninglounge/nlp-end-to-end-cll-nlp-workshop-2)\n\n\n## Bahdanau Attention\n\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/639/1*qhOlQHLdtfZORIXYuoCtaA.png\">\n\n\nBahdanau et al. proposed an attention mechanism that learns to align and translate jointly. It is also known as Additive attention as it performs a linear combination of encoder states and the decoder states.\n\nlet’s understand the Attention mechanism suggested by Bahdanau\n\nAll hidden states of the encoder(forward and backward) and the decoder are used to generate the context vector, unlike how just the last encoder hidden state is used in seq2seq without attention.\nThe attention mechanism aligns the input and output sequences, with an alignment score parameterized by a feed-forward network. It helps to pay attention to the most relevant information in the source sequence.\nThe model predicts a target word based on the context vectors associated with the source position and the previously generated target words.\nAlignment Score\nThe alignment score maps how well the inputs around position “j” and the output at position “i” match. The score is based on the previous decoder’s hidden state, s₍ᵢ₋₁₎ just before predicting the target word and the hidden state, hⱼ of the input sentence.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/535/1*u2YdTRPjN34Fpr-zxvoJsg.png\">\n\n\nThe decoder decides which part of the source sentence it needs to pay attention to, instead of having encoder encode all the information of the source sentence into a fixed-length vector. The alignment vector that has the same length with the source sequence and is computed at every time step of the decode.\n\nAttention Weights\nWe apply a softmax activation function to the alignment scores to obtain the attention weights.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/685/1*3aCyU9aSVHvxzOwvQdExdQ.png\">\n\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/images/seq2seq/attention_mechanism.jpg\">\n\n<img src=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/images/seq2seq/attention_equation_0.jpg\">\n\n\n\n\n## Luong Attention\n\n\n\n\n### Global Attention\n\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/626/1*LhEapXF1mtaB3rDgIjcceg.png\">\n\nLuong, et al., 2015 proposed the “global” and “local” attention. The global attention is similar to the soft attention, while the local one is an interesting blend between hard and soft, an improvement over the hard attention to make it differentiable: the model first predicts a single aligned position for the current target word and a window centered around the source position is then used to compute a context vector.\n\nThe commonality between Global and Local attention\n\n- At each time step t, in the decoding phase, both approaches, global and local attention, first take the hidden state hₜ at the top layer of a stacking LSTM as an input.\n- The goal of both approaches is to derive a context vector 𝒸ₜ to capture relevant source-side information to help predict the current target word yₜ\n- Attentional vectors are fed as inputs to the next time steps to inform the model about past alignment decisions.\n- Global and local attention models differ in how the context vector 𝒸ₜ is derived\n- Before we discuss the global and local attention, let’s understand the conventions used by Luong’s attention mechanism for any given time t\n\n   - 𝒸ₜ : context vector\n   - aₜ : alignment vector\n   - hₜ : current target hidden state\n   - hₛ : current source hidden state\n   - yₜ: predicted current target word\n   - h˜ₜ : Attentional vectors\n   \n   \nThe global attentional model considers all the hidden states of the encoder when calculating the context vector 𝒸ₜ.\n\nA variable-length alignment vector aₜ equal to the size of the number of time steps in the source sequence is derived by comparing the current target hidden state hₜ with each of the source hidden state hₛ\nThe alignment score is referred to as a content-based function for which we consider three different alternatives\n\n\n### Local Attention\n\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/538/1*YXjdGl3CnSfHfzYpQiObgg.png\">\n\n\n\n- Local attention only focuses on a small subset of source positions per target words unlike the entire source sequence as in global attention\n- Computationally less expensive than global attention\n- The local attention model first generates an aligned position Pₜ for each target word at time t.\n- The context vector 𝒸ₜ is derived as a weighted average over the set of source hidden states within selected the window\n- The aligned position can be monotonically or predictively selected\n\n\n### Formulation\n\n\n<img

more semantic information. Self-attention is the method the Transformer uses to bake the “understanding” of other relevant words into the one we’re currently processing. [Jay's Blog](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) provide a very good idea of this logic.\n\n\n<img src=\"http://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self-attention_visualization.png\">\n\nThree vectors q,k and v (query,key and value) are taken into consideration for computation of the self attention mechanism.The q,k and v are normally of 64 dimensions.\n\n\n<img src=\"http://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self_attention_vectors.png\">\n\nThe score is calculated by taking the dot product of the query vector with the key vector of the respective word we’re scoring. So if we’re processing the self-attention for the word in position #1, the first score would be the dot product of q1 and k1. The second score would be the dot product of q1 and k2.\n\n<img src=\"http://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self_attention_score.png\">\n\n\nThe third and forth steps are to divide the scores by 8 (the square root of the dimension of the key vectors used in the paper – 64. This leads to having more stable gradients. There could be other possible values here, but this is the default), then pass the result through a softmax operation. Softmax normalizes the scores so they’re all positive and add up to 1.\n\n\n<img src=\"http://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention_softmax.png\">\n\n\nThis softmax score determines how much each word will be expressed at this position. Clearly the word at this position will have the highest softmax score, but sometimes it’s useful to attend to another word that is relevant to the current word. The fifth step is to multiply each value vector by the softmax score (in preparation to sum them up). The intuition here is to keep intact the values of the word(s) we want to focus on, and drown-out irrelevant words (by multiplying them by tiny numbers like 0.001, for example). The sixth step is to sum up the weighted value vectors. This produces the output of the self-attention layer at this position (for the first word).\n\n<img src=\"http://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-output.png\">\n\n\nThe computation process

SOTA Transformer models. In this context, it is useful to mention some important resources:\n\n- Transformer Keras(https://keras.io/examples/nlp/text_classification_with_transformer/)\n- Kaggle Kernel(https://www.kaggle.com/suicaokhoailang/lstm-attention-baseline-0-652-lb)\n\nHowever in this case, since we would be using the models just for extracting embeddings or features, it is important to know the intermediate layers which should be chosen. Since Transformer architectures are really huge, (BERT/GPT variants), it is very complicated to fully understand which layer should be extracted for the features. While BERT, the first Transformer, relies on 2 tokens ([CLS] and [SEP]) ,extracting the sentence embedding vectors are done after extracting the last output layer. However , different models have different number of layers, and in this case, we will exploring a model agnostic way to extract sentence embeddings and performing similarity check with all of the models.\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http://jalammar.github.io/images/bert-next-sentence-prediction.png\">\n\n\n## BERT Embeddings\n\n[BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) is a traditional SOTA transformer architecture published by Google Research which uses bidirectional pretraining . The importance of using BERT is that it has 2 important aspects:\n\nMsked Language Model (MLM)\nNext Sentence Prediction(NSP)\nThe bidirectional pre-training is essentially helpful to be used for any tasks. The Huggingface implementation is helpful for fine-tuning BERT for any language modelling task. The BERT architecture falls under an encoder-decoder(Transformer) model as follows:\n\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/876/0*ViwaI3Vvbnd-CJSQ.png\">\n\n<img src=\"https://d3i71xaburhd42.cloudfront.net/df2b0e26d0599ce3e70df8a9da02e51594e0e992/15-Figure4-1.png\">\n\n\n## Extracting Embeddings from BERT variant Transformers\n\nFor finetuning, it is to be kept in mind, there are many ways to do this. We are using BERT from Huggingface repository while it can also be used from [TF-HUB](https://tfhub.dev/s?module-type=text-embedding) or from [Google-Research](https://github.com/google-research/bert) repository. The reason for using HuggingFace is that the same codebase is applicable for all language models. The 3 most important input features that any language model asks for is:\n\n- input_ids\n- attention_masks\n- token_ids\n\nLet us first try to analyse and understand how BERT tokenizers, and model can be used in this context. The BERT documentation provides an outline of how to use BERT tokenizers and also modify it for downstream tasks.\n\nGenerally by virtue of transfer learning through weight transfer, we use pretrained BERT models from the list. This allows us to finetune it to extract only the embeddings. Since we are using Keras, we have to build up a small model containing an Input Layer and apply the tokenized(encoded) input ids, attention masks as input to the pretrained and loaded BERT model.This is very similar to creating a very own classification model for BERT using Keras/Tensorflow, but since we will be needing only the Embeddings it is safe to extract only the sentence vectors in the last layer of the model output. In most of the cases , we will see that the dimensions of the output vector is (x,768) where x depends on the number of tokenized input features. For this we extract the [CLS] tokenized feature from the ouput to just extract the sentence embeddings.\n\n\n<img src=\"http://jalammar.github.io/images/distilBERT/bert-output-tensor-selection.png\">\n\n\nSo the following pattern is to be done for our use case:\n\n- First Attain BERT embeddings by capturing the last hidden state output\n- Create the standard Neural network model (which we created till now)\n- In the Embedding Layer fit the BERT embeddings\n- Apply Self-Attention/any Attention mechanism on BERT embeddings\n- Apply FFNN Dense Networks with required activation functions\n\nby BERT , I mean all transformer models  under huggingface [pretrained library](https://huggingface.co/transformers/pretrained_models.html)\n\n\n\nSome resources and source codes:\n\n- [My NLP Kernels](https://kaggle.com/abhilash1910)\n- [Extensive Word Embeddings with Distilbert/Roberta/XL NET](https://www.kaggle.com/colearninglounge/nlp-end-to-end-cll-nlp-workshop#BERT-Embeddings-with-Alternate-Strategy)\n- [NLP workshop-2](https://www.kaggle.com/abhilash1910/nlp-workshop-2-ml-india)\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/esciencegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/01.png?resize=506%2C641&ssl=1\">","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from transformers import BertTokenizer, TFBertModel\nfrom scipy.spatial.distance import cosine\nimport tensorflow as tf\ndef get_embeddings(model_name,tokenizer,name,inp):\n    #Specify which transformer model will be used\n    tokenizer = tokenizer.from_pretrained(name)\n    model = model_name.from_pretrained(name)\n    input_ids = tf.constant(tokenizer.encode(inp))[None, :]  #

Exploring Generative Transformers - GPT2\n\n\n<img src=\"http://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt2/openAI-GPT-2-3.png\">\n\n\nIt is a [robust model](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf). GPT-2 is a large transformer-based language model with 1.5 billion parameters, trained on a dataset[1] of 8 million web pages. GPT-2 is trained with a simple objective: predict the next word, given all of the previous words within some text. The diversity of the dataset causes this simple goal to contain naturally occurring demonstrations of many tasks across diverse domains. GPT-2 is a direct scale-up of GPT, with more than 10X the parameters and trained on more than 10X the amount of data.Some important aspects:\n\nGPT-2 is a model with absolute position embeddings so it’s usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather than the left.\n\nGPT-2 was trained with a causal language modeling (CLM) objective and is therefore powerful at predicting the next token in a sequence. Leveraging this feature allows GPT-2 to generate syntactically coherent text as it can be observed in the run_generation.py example script.\n\nGPT-2 is a decoder Transformer model. Generally most transformers are encoder-decoders, but in the case of GPT-2 this is a decoder-only model. GPT-2 has stacks of decoder cells on top of one another, and inside each decoder block resides -Masked Self Attention and FFNN (Dense) Networks.\n\n\n<img src=\"http://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt2/gpt2-self-attention-qkv-1-2.png\">\n\n\n\n## Masked Self Attention\n\n\nThis is the core part which separated GPT from BERT variants:\n\n\n<img src=\"http://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt2/self-attention-and-masked-self-attention.png\">\n\n\nMore details can be found here:\n\n- [NLP](https://www.kaggle.com/colearninglounge/nlp-end-to-end-cll-nlp-workshop-2)\n- [NLP](https://www.kaggle.com/abhilash1910/nlp-workshop-2-ml-india)\n- [Jay's blog](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#For GPT variants, it is important to know that these use 'PAD' tokens additionally and are used from left to right.\n#Unlike BERT variants which are bidirectional in nature, GPT is more of a left to right tokenizer due to the Masking of Attention.\n\ndef transformer_gpt_embedding(model_name,name,inp):\n\n    model = model_name.from_pretrained(name)\n    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(name)\n    tokenizer.pad_token = \"[PAD]\"\n    pipe = pipeline('feature-extraction', model=model, \n                tokenizer=tokenizer)\n    features = pipe(inp)\n    features = np.squeeze(features)\n    return features\n\ninput_word1='playing'\ninput_word2='photography'\n#Retrieve the GPT-2 word embeddings\ncls_token1=transformer_gpt_embedding(TFGPT2Model,'openai-gpt',input_word1)\ncls_token2=transformer_gpt_embedding(TFGPT2Model,'openai-gpt',input_word2)\n\n#Measure the distance between the embeddings\ndistance=1-cosine(cls_token1,cls_token2)\nprint('Word Pair Similarity',distance)\n#Plot the distance\nplt.plot(cls_token1)\nplt.plot(cls_token2)\n\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-09T10:21:28.587787Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-09T10:21:28.588048Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-09T10:22:13.194843Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-09T10:21:28.588018Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-09T10:22:13.193840Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Downloading:   0%|          | 0.00/656 [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"2ed8dad0e0264e36aefc4b87ab3dae97"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stderr","text":"You are using a model of type openai-gpt to instantiate a model of type gpt2.

In the first case, it is important to note that tokenizer.encode_plus uses some arguements which include the input_ids, attention masks and segment ids /token_type_ids . We can also see the input ids by converting them to a list. Since we will only be using the forward pass of the Bert base transformer for QA inference, it is important to write ```torch.no_grad()``` to speed up performance for larger inference datasets. The outputs of the model contain scores in the form of tensors. The QA pipeline output can be used to segment the range containing the maximum scores between the start and the end tokens. The rest of the part involves detokenization of the tokens in the specified maximum value range. The answer is then received by using ```tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_string``` method. This is a simpler way to write a QA pipeline using torch.\n\nResources:\n\n- [HF](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/pipelines.html#transformers.QuestionAnsweringPipeline)\n- [Blog](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/blob/master/TensorFlow/LanguageModeling/BERT/notebooks/bert_squad_tf_inference_colab.ipynb)\n- [Blog](https://mccormickml.com/2020/03/10/question-answering-with-a-fine-tuned-BERT/#:~:text=Super%20Bowl%2050.-,BERT%20Input%20Format,question%20from%20the%20reference%20text.)\n- [QApipeline](https://huggingface.co/transformers/_modules/transformers/pipelines/question_answering.html#QuestionAnsweringPipeline)\n\n<img src=\"http://www.mccormickml.com/assets/BERT/SQuAD/start_token_classification.png\">","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import torch\nimport numpy as np\nmodel=AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('huggingface/prunebert-base-uncased-6-finepruned-w-distil-squad')\ntokenizer=AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('huggingface/prunebert-base-uncased-6-finepruned-w-distil-squad')\ndef inference(question,context):\n    question_first=bool(tokenizer.padding_side=='right')\n    max_answer_len=5\n    encoded_text=tokenizer.encode_plus(question,context,padding='longest',\n                    truncation=\"longest_first\" ,\n                    max_length=512,\n                    stride=30,\n                    return_tensors=\"pt\",\n                    return_token_type_ids=False,\n                    return_overflowing_tokens=False,\n                    return_offsets_mapping=False,\n                    return_special_tokens_mask=False)\n    input_ids=encoded_text['input_ids'].tolist()[0]\n    #print(input_ids)\n    tokens=tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(input_ids)\n    with torch.no_grad():\n        outputs=model(**encoded_text)\n#     answer_st=outputs.start_logits\n#     answer_et=outputs.end_logits\n    start_,end_=outputs[:2]\n    answer_start=torch.argmax(start_)\n    answer_end=torch.argmax(end_)+1\n    answer=tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_string(tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(input_ids[answer_start:answer_end]))\n    print(answer)\n    \nquestion= 'How many parameters does Bert large have?'\ncontext= 'Bert is really large...it has 24 layers, for a total of 340M parameters.Altogether it is 1.34 GB so expect it to take a couple minutes to download to your Colab instance.'    \ninference(question,context)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-09T10:49:10.623398Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-09T10:49:10.623745Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-09T10:49:45.213870Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-09T10:49:10.623696Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-09T10:49:45.213001Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":28,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Downloading:   0%|          | 0.00/1.27k [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"d71418a0ac09441dbbbe81c383fcc4ee"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Downloading:   0%|          | 0.00/438M [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"acfa6566e5804506a47799d888a33744"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Downloading:   0%|          | 0.00/232k [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"15a9214b255b4803814b300afa2df5e6"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Downloading:   0%|          | 0.00/112 [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"aefbab3eea444fc0a4815f892ae5d35e"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Downloading:   0%|          | 0.00/39.0 [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"2433ef8ae5944487ab2a5fd168e54dec"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stdout","text":"340m parameters. altogether it is 1. 34 gb\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Summarization using T5 Encoder-Decoder Transformer\n\nIn this case, we are using a Enc-Dec T5 transformer for summarization task.

decoder GPT2 transformer. The steps are as follows:\n\n- Since GPT2 uses special tokens , we are specifying them : bos_token,eos_token specify the beginning and end of sentence respectively. There are additional tokens which include unk (for unknows), pad(padding) and sep (separator) token as in BERT\n- We first load the GPT2 transformer with the added special tokens parameter set in the tokenzier config.\n- We load the GPT2 model from with the special tokens and also resize the models token embeddings using the ```model.resize_token_embedding`` method\n- We first tokenize the data tor torch tensors and use the forward pass of  the GPT 2 model.\n- In this case we are using the beam generation mechanism, and selecting the topk items from the resulting tensors. There is also a ```repitition_penalty``` applied which implies that the model will try to avoid predicting same tokens.\n- The next part is decoding the tokens by using ```tokenizer.decode``` method as specified earlier and we get the final predicted generations\n\nSome blogs related to beam search and topk sampling/nucleus sampling\n\n- [Blog HF](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate)\n-

This is done in the ```gather_pre_entities``` method\n- The next step is aggregating subwords/subtokens into complete couterparts so that they can be represented as a single NER tag.The aggregation strategy is specified as None we return the entities. Else the aggregation happens by grouping subwords on their relative scores(average etc) for creating the tags. These are in the ```aggreagate_word`` method\n- The final step is returning all the tokens combined together and removing [0] token since it can be ignored for NER.\n- The resultant output provides the NER tags of all the items and their corresponding scores\n\n<img src=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347087784/figure/fig2/AS:1003243366780929@1616203266581/Illustration-of-BERT-models-for-A-NER-B-family-member-attributes-including-side-and.ppm\">\n\nResource:\n\n- [HF](https://huggingface.co/transformers/_modules/transformers/pipelines/question_answering.html#QuestionAnsweringPipeline)\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from transformers import AutoTokenizer,AutoModelForTokenClassification\nimport torch\nimport numpy as np\n\ntokenizer=AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('dbmdz/electra-large-discriminator-finetuned-conll03-english')\nmodel=AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained('dbmdz/electra-large-discriminator-finetuned-conll03-english')\n\nclass AggregationStrategy:\n    \"\"\"All the valid aggregation strategies for TokenClassificationPipeline\"\"\"\n\n    NONE = \"none\"\n    SIMPLE = \"simple\"\n    FIRST = \"first\"\n    AVERAGE = \"average\"\n    MAX = \"max\"\ndef gather_pre_entities(sentence: str,input_ids: np.ndarray,scores: np.ndarray,offset_mapping,special_tokens_mask: np.ndarray) :\n    \"\"\"Fuse various numpy arrays into dicts with all the information needed for aggregation\"\"\"\n    pre_entities = []\n    for idx, token_scores in enumerate(scores):\n        #

models and transform them to use Transformers. We have seen the Transformer embeddings which can be used for any downstream task such as classfication, and have also created finetuned model based on BERT base/ (or any bert variant) for the classification task. We have also looked into different attention strategies and transformer architecture in depth. Finally we have learnt how to use pretrained models and write custom inference modules for some of the most popular downstream tasks which include token classification (NER),QA,text classification,text2textparaphrasing, text generation, and summarization. For additional inference logics related to zero shot classification , it is present in the [Github gist](https://gist.github.com/abhilash1910/5e2bee7c3eccea843a8e9406b221d8f2) and also for other inference tasks based on transformers are present in my [Github](https://gist.github.com/abhilash1910). This concludes the session on Transformers.","metadata":{}}]}
